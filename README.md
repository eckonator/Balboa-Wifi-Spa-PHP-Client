# Balboa Wifi Spa PHP Script for getting and setting Spa states
## You can set the desired temperature, turn on pumps an lights on and off

I use this script to run the heater only, if my pv generator produces enough power.

### Installation
Change IP address in index.php on line 5 to the IP address from your balboa spa:

````
$spaClient = new SpaClient('192.168.178.xxx');
````

### Some examples to use
